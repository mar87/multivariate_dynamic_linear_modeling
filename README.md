Project completed by Megan Robertson for Statistics 642 - Time Series and Dynamic Modeling at Duke University in Spring 2017 with Professor Mike West.

This project investigates the  utility of time series modeling applied to player tracking data from NBA games. The goal of this project is to determine if an NBA player's movements are statistically exchangeable. Multivariate dynamic linear models were fit using discount factor based methods to the tracking data for Avery Bradley, a guard on the Boston Celtics (at the time). Multiple models were fit to two different uninterrupted sections of game play. Feed forward intervention was used to account for Bradley's changes in direction throughout the game. The marginal likelihoods of the discount factors are compared in order to determine if the movement of the player is statistically exchangeable.
